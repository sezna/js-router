# Router Lite
This project is a lighter weight alternative to the feature-rich routers like React Router. It has no dependencies and only provides basic routing capabilities. It supports URL parameters and provides an overrideable 404 page. A Link component is also included. 

It is currently a huge WIP and isn't ready for release yet
